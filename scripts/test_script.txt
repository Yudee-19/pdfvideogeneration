Stress: Accused of killing longevity.
Many people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down much faster during periods of crisis.
The American Institute of Stress investigated this degenerative process and concluded that most health problems are caused by stress.
Researchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which they subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more stressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes.
Afterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his antibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating the proteins that trigger an immune response.
The problem is that this response not only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to age prematurely.
The University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and samples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness of one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with healthy children and low levels of stress.
They found that stress promotes cellular aging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular regeneration and how our cells age.
As the study revealed, the greater the stress, the greater the degenerative effect on cells.
